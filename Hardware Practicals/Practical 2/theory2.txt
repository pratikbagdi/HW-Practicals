Aim :-
To interface LED with Intel Galileo board and write a program to turn on LED repeatedly after every one second interval.

Tool :-
Sr No.	Tools			Specifications		Qty
1	Development Kit		IoT 3500 Kit		1
2	Computer System		4GB RAM,  1TB HDD	1
3	LED Display		LD15, for Galileo 	1

Theory :-
Steps to implement above statement in Galileo board: 
1)	Plug Galileo to computer and power on.
2)	Power computer system enter passwords.
3)	Open ‘Eclipse IDE’ on Linux OS that is already installed.
4)	All the programs were given in workspace of Eclipse.
5)	Click on create connection  new connection  enter Galileo IP address and name your connection.  
6)	Click Next  right click on connection  click start connection  connection will now change to green.
7)	 Write appropriate program and run by clicking on run button.
8)	 Write command to interface LED to Galileo 
9)	Upload the code to Galileo and click on run.

Result :-
Compilation and Installation of LED interfacing after every one second is done and process understood.

Conclusion :-
Target board of such types can be used in low-cost system designs using very less amount of components and can be used for many user defined application.
