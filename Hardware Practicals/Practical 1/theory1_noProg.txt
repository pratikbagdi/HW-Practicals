Aim :-
Study of IoT 3500 development kit and familiarization with Intel Galileo board and perform necessary software installations.

Tool :-
Sr.no.	Tools				Specifications		Qty
1	IoT 3500 Development Kit	Intel Galileo kit	1
2	Computer System			4 GB+RAM, 1 TB HDD	1
3	Bootable Pen drive		32 GB 			1

Theory :-
Steps to configure Intel Galileo board:
1)	Assemble the hardware from IoT kit box intel / Galileo and connect Galileo board to the power through adaptor given.
2)	Take out the SanDisk 32GB pen drive that is already loaded with Galileo Linux supportable OS username as IoT. Attach it to the computer, restart your computer as IoT and select pen drive in 1st position of boot order in BIOS settings.
3)	Save the settings. Now OS will load into your computer, login by entering password (IOT123).
4)	All necessary software are already installed in this OS, now go to the terminal, and write the following command. Make sure to attach Galileo to computer using SDTF to USB port cable. 
5)	Power on Galileo and write command on OS terminal: SUDO screen usbtty 020511.
6)	This will load Galileo terminal on OS terminal.
7)	Now Galileo will require password, enter “iot123”.
8)	Now type Comment command in Galileo prompt.
9)	Type “search wifi” in terminal by plugging “wifi receiver module” to computer, then you will be listed sum of SSID's of available wifi.
10)	Copy ID of your wifi_ssid and type “add wifi wifi_ssid” and hit enter.
11)	Now your Galileo board is also connected to internet exit by removing FTDI cable from computer.
12)	Now all configurations have been done.

Program :-
None

Conclusion :-
Study of IoT 3500 Development Kit and familiarization with Intel Galileo board and perform necessary software installations successfully.
