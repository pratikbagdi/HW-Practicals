4 	Jumper Wires			-			1

Theory :-
Steps to interface the LCD display and write a program to display text.
1)	Connect the VCC pin of the LCD display to the VCC pin on the Galileo board.
2)	Connect the GND pin of the LCD display to the GND pin on the Galileo board.
3)	Connect the SDA pin of the LCD display to the SDA pin on the Galileo board.
4)	Connect the SCL pin of the LCD display to the SCL pin on the Galileo board.
5)	Connect the Galileo board to a computers and open Arduino IDE.
6)	Go to “Sketeli” -> “Include Library” -> “Manage libraries”.
7)	In the library Manager. Search for “liquid crystal 12C”.
8)	Install the “liquid crystal 12C” library by Arduino.

Result :-
After uploading the process is complete. The LCD display should start showing the message.

Conclusion :-
To interface LCD Display with intel Galileo board and write a program to display some text has been implemented successfully.
