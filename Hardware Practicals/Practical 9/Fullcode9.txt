* @file LCD.cpp
* @brief  Demonstrate how to use the 16x2 LCD with RGB backlight connected to
*  Intel Galileo board using UPM library
*
* LCD module used here is JHD1313M1 which has an I2C controller for the 16x2
* LCD and an RGB backlight LED controller PCA9633 also I2C based. Hence the
* module has two I2C addresses: one belongs to LCD controller that controls the
* HD44780-based display, and the other controls only the backlight.
*
* @note Grove LCD RGB Backlight module needs to be connected to Galileo Arduino
*  via base shield's I2C port.
* @note Grove LCD needs 5V to operate normally, ensure Grove shield switch
* is set to 5V
* @note Galileo has an exposed I2C bus = 0 and I2C addresses:
* LCD controller = 0x3E ; RGB LED = 0x62.
* @note Additional linker flags: "upm-i2clcd".

/**
 * @brief Main function for printing text on LCD and changing backlight colors
 *
 * It performs following tasks:
 * 1. Creates an instance lcd of class Jhd1313m1 using UPM.
 * 2. Set cursor position
 * 3. Print text
 * 4. Enter loop to toggle backlight color between Red->Green->Blue at
 * intervals of 1 second.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code{.c}
 * int main(void)
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param void This function does not take any input parameter.
 * @return Returns 0.
 *
 * @see http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/classupm_1_1_jhd1313m1.html
 *
 * @note UPM library has dependency on MRAA library functions.
 *
 * @warning None.
