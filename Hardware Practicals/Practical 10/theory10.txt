Aim :-
To interface rotary angle sensor/ potentiometer with the Galileo board and write a program to control the readings of sensor of changing the angle of potentiometer.

Tool :-
Sr.no.	Tools				Specifications		Qty
1	IoT 3500 Development Kit	Intel Galileo kit	1
2	Computer System			4GB RAM,1TB HDD		1
3	Rotary Angle Senser		-			1
4 	Jumper Wires			-			1

Theory :-
Steps to interface rotary angle senser with the Galileo board and write a program to control the readings of the sensor are as follows:
1)	Connect the Grove Rotary Angle Sensor to an analog port (A1) on the shield. Then, connect the shield to the Galileo board.
2)	Open Arduino IDE. Go to sketch -> Include library -> Manage libraries. Search for “UPM” for install the “GroveUPM” library by Arduino.
3)	Copy the provided program code into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
4)	Go to Tools -> Board and select “Galileo” or “Galileo Gen2” depending on your board. Then go to Tools -> Port and  Select the COM port your Galileo board is connected to.
5)	Click the upload button to upload the program to your Galileo board.
6)	Open the serial monitor by going to Tools -> Serial Monitor. Set band rate to 9600 (usually the default).
7)	Turn the knob of the rotary sensor. You should see readings on the serial monitor that update every second. 

Result :-
When we run the program and rotate the knob of the rotary sensor, we see output on the serial monitor that updates every second.

Conclusion :-
The practical successfully demonstrates how to interface a rotary angle sensor (or potentiometer) with a Galileo board. The provided program reads the sensor values and displays them on the serial monitor allowing to observe the relationship between the sensors physical rotation and output readings.
